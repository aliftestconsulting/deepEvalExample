The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. 
It was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. 

Construction began in 1887 and was completed in 1889 as the entrance arch for the 1889 World's Fair. 
The tower is 330 meters tall and was the tallest structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York in 1930. 

Today, it remains one of the most visited monuments in the world, attracting nearly seven million visitors annually.
